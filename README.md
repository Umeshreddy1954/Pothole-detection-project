# Pothole Detection System

This project uses deep learning models (ResNet50, VGG19, YOLOv8) to detect potholes in images. It is built using Flask for the web application and MySQL for user authentication.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload an image to detect potholes.
- **Deep Learning Models**: The system uses pretrained deep learning models (ResNet50, VGG19, YOLOv8) for pothole detection.
- **Web Application**: Built with Flask for handling the frontend and backend.
- **User Authentication**: MySQL-based login/register functionality to protect access to the upload feature.
