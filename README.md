# 🕳️ Pothole Detection Project

A computer vision-based web application for detecting potholes in road images using deep learning and OpenCV techniques.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to assist in road safety and maintenance by detecting potholes in uploaded images using multiple models:
- **ResNet50**
- **VGG19**
- **YOLOv8**

The app is built using **Flask**, with an easy-to-use web interface and secure user authentication.
